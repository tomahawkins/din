# Alpine Ski Bindings Settings

This project provides a model, testbench,
and reference JavaScript calculator for the ISO 11088-2018
standard, aka. DIN, for setting the release torque
for alpine ski bindings.
It was motivated by the discovery of several errors
in many online DIN calculators -- we have yet to find
a calculator that uses the latest standard and is error free.

- Din.hs:  The Haskell model of ISO 110088-2018.
- Din.js:  A corresponding calculator written in JavaScript.
- DinTests.js:  A testsuite for JavaScript DIN calculators.
